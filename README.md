# Shop-it

[Shop-it](https://shop-it-now.vercel.app/) is a fake e-commerce website where you can find all sorts of products.

It is built with NextJS and it uses Typescript along with MUI, React Query and the [API DummyJSON](https://dummyjson.com/).
This project is my introduction to Typescript as well as a React component library, in this case, MUI. This website has been built in a mobile-first approach.

To make this website the most realistic, I've used localStorage to store the the products put in favorites by the user just like the cart. To keep data safe from user updates, I've decided to only store ID's of product then fetch it from thanks to the ID.
Then, to access the favorite list or the cart I use react hooks, useContext and useReducer.

There are 2 things present in the project that aren't working and that I won't implement (or not for the moment). I'm talking about the search page/ search function and profile page. The rest of the application is supposed to work ()
